# Build the Conda Package:
    
Navigate to the conda.recipe directory and run:

    conda build .

This command will build the Conda package.

# Install and Test the Package:

After building the package, you can install and test it using:

    conda install -c local my_package

Make sure to replace local with the channel where the package was built.

Remember, this is a simplified example. For more complex packages, you might need to handle additional dependencies, licenses, documentation, and more. It's also important to follow best practices, ensure your package is well-tested, and consider using version control systems like Git to manage your codebase.

# Publish pushed version of conda package

    gh release create --latest "v$(python setup.py --version)" --title "v$(python setup.py --version)" --notes ""
